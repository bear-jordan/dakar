# Senegal (~Jan 31 -- Feb 2 2026)
*   **Start Date**: ~Jan 31, 2026
*   **End Date**: ~Feb 2, 2026
*   **Duration**: ~3 Days
*   **Visa**: Visa-free (<90 days). "Senegal 1 Car Pass" required.

## 1. Pre-Entry Prep
*   **Mandatory Border**: **DIAMA** (via Diwaling National Park). **AVOID ROSSO** (Banditry/Corruption).
*   **Paperwork**: "Senegal 1 Car Pass" (~170 €). Arranged in advance. Includes insurance and Passavant.
    *   *Note*: This allows vehicles >7 years old to enter without massive fees.
*   **Convoy**: Must cross as a single group to use the Car Pass agreement.

## 2. Route & Driving Conditions
*   **The Diama Road**:
    *   **Condition**: "Hideous and Awesome". Potholes, mud (if wet), dust gullies.
    *   **Technique**: Leave space for visibility. If dry, track alongside the road might be better.
*   **Main Roads**:
    *   **Hazard**: **SPEED BUMPS**. Massive, unpainted "launch ramps". Often marked by boulders/logs on the side.
    *   **Corrupt Police**: Watch for aggressive stops (e.g., Thies). Do not hand over original documents if possible. Use copies.
*   **Navigation**:
    *   Do not follow SatNav blindly leaving Diama (avoids mud bath). Follow instructions: Straight until Y-junction, then Right.

## 3. Required Stops
*   **Zebrabar (Rao/St Louis)**:
    *   **Status**: Mandatory rest/repair stop.
    *   **Facilities**: Ramps, mechanic, showers, cold beer (honesty bar).
    *   **Payment**: Cash (CFA/Euro) or Sendwave app.
*   **Route to Gambia**:
    *   Leave Zebrabar early. Meet at **Karang Border** by 12:00 Midday.

## 4. Safety & Culture (Practical)
*   **Currency**: CFA (West African Franc). Linked to Euro.
*   **Culture**: More liberal dress code than Mauritania. Vibrant.
*   **Fuel**: Cheaper than Mauritania. Fill up near Zebrabar.

## 5. Pre-Exit Checklist
*   **Customs**: Must "sign out" vehicle from Senegal to enter Gambia.
*   **Group Exit**: Must cross Karang border together to adhere to the car pass rules.
