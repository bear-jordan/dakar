# Car Diagnostics & "Bush Mechanic" Cheat Sheet

**Goal**: Identify scary noises and apply temporary fixes to get you to a mechanic.
**Rule #1**: Stop and check **before** the loud noise becomes a bang.

## 1. Noises: What is that sound?

| Sound | Likely Cause | The "Get Home" Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Squealing** (Loud screech on startup) | **Loose Fan/Aux Belt** | **Tighten it**. Locate the tensioner bolt. If broken, see "Bush Fixes" below. |
| **Hissing + Steam** | **Overheating / Rad Leak** | **STOP IMMEDIATELY**. Let engine cool (30 mins). Check coolant level. Do not open cap while hot. |
| **Clicking** (Loudest when turning) | **CV Joint (Axle)** | **Drive Gentle**. Avoid full-lock turns. It will hold for a while, but fails eventually. |
| **Grinding** (Metal-on-Metal when braking) | **Worn Brake Pads** | **Engine Braking**. Use gears to slow down. Minimize brake pedal use. Replace ASAP. |
| **Roaring/Humming** (Gets louder with speed) | **Wheel Bearing** | **Monitor Heat**. Touch the wheel hub at stops. If it's scorching hot, stop driving (wheel may seize/fall off). |
| **Clunking** (Going over bumps) | **Suspension/Mounts** | **Slow Down**. A shock absorber or bush is dead. Annoying but usually driveable to the next town. |

## 2. "Bush Mechanic" Fixes (The Bodge Jobs)
*Use these ONLY to limp to a garage. They are not permanent.*

### The Radiator Leak (Hissing/Puddle)
*   **The Problem**: Stone chip or crack in the radiator.
*   **The Fixes**:
    1.  **K-Seal / Radweld**: Pour into the radiator (if you brought it).
    2.  **Egg White**: Crack an egg, pour ONLY the white into the radiator. It cooks and plugs the hole.
    3.  **Black Pepper**: Pour a handful in. Swells to plug small holes.
    4.  **Chewing Gum**: Chew it, stick it on the outside of the visible hole (dry the area first).

### The Broken Fan Belt (Overheating + Battery Light)
*   **The Problem**: The belt driving your water pump and alternator has snapped.
*   **The Fix**: **Tights (Pantyhose)**.
    *   Wrap a pair of tights tightly around the pulleys and tie a strong knot. It provides enough friction to turn the water pump for short distances.

### The Fuel Tank Leak (Smell of Gas)
*   **The Problem**: Rock punctured the metal tank.
*   **The Fix**: **Bar of Soap**.
    *   Rub a bar of soap firmly over the crack/hole. The petrol reacts with the soap to form a temporary gummy seal.

### The Exhaust Fell Off (Loud Dragging Noise)
*   **The Fix**: **Wire Coat Hanger or Empty Beer Can**.
    *   Wire it back up to the chassis. Use a cut-open beer can and jubilee clips (hose clamps) as a bandage over a hole.

### The Dust-Choked Engine (Black Smoke / Low Power)
*   **The Problem**: Air filter is clogged with Saharan dust.
*   **The Fix**: **Bang it out**.
    *   Take the filter out. Whack it against a tyre or wall to dislodge the dust. Re-install.

## 3. Vital Fluids Checklist (Daily Morning Check)
*   **Oil**: Check dipstick.
    *   *Milky/Chocolately?* Head gasket blown (Water mixing with oil). Game over mostly.
    *   *Low?* Top up. Any oil is better than no oil.
*   **Coolant**: Check level.
    *   *Top up*: Use water if you have no coolant.
*   **Brake Fluid**: Check reservoir.
    *   *Low?* You have a leak. Brakes will fail. Find a mechanic immediately.

## 4. When to Call It Quits (Tow It)
*   **Red Oil Pressure Light**: Stop engine instantly.
*   **Temperature Gauge in Red**: Stop engine instantly.
*   **Knocking/Banging from deep inside engine**: Rod threw. Engine dead.
