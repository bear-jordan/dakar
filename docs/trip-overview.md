This document serves as the high-level operational "Command Center" for the expedition. It details the critical path, daily drive rhythms, and key deadlines.

## The Critical Path (Deadlines)
Failure to meet these deadlines may result in missing the convoy, border crossings, or the finish line events.

*   **Jan 15 (Day 1)**: **START** (Portsmouth). Ferry to Santander.
*   **Jan 17 (Day 3)**: **Arrival** in Santander. Drive South.
*   **Jan 19 (Day 5)**: **DEADLINE** - Arrival at **Mesón de Sancho** (Cadiz/Tarifa).
*   **Jan 21 (Day 7)**: **Ferry Crossing** to Tangier Med (09:00 AM sailing).

## Daily Rhythm & Drive Loads

### 1. Europe: The Cruise (Jan 15 - 21)
*   **Objective**: Relax and arrive in Spain fresh.
*   **Route**: Portsmouth -> Santander (Brittany Ferries) -> Cadiz.
*   **Drive Load**: **Low**. 2 nights on ferry. 1-2 days driving in Spain (~1000km).
*   **Reality**: A significant upgrade from the original "Sprint".
*   **Fuel**: Fill up in Spain (cheaper than France/UK).

### 2. Morocco: The Marathon (Jan 21 - 30)
*   **Distance**: ~2,000 km (Tangier to Barbas).
*   **Drive Load**: **~5-7 Hours/Day** (North) -> **~7-9 Hours/Day** (South/Western Sahara).
*   **Reality**: North is slow (mountains/traffic). South is fast but monotonous (endless desert highway).
*   **Hazards**: Speed traps (Sign trick!), Night driving (Don't do it).

### 3. The Desert: The Challenge (Jan 31 - Feb 2)
*   **Distance**: ~500 km (Barbas to Nouakchott).
*   **Drive Load**: **~8-12 Hours/Day** (Variable).
*   **Reality**: "No Man's Land" crossing takes hours. The drive to Nouakchott is paved but potholed and windy.
*   **Logistics**: **Jerry cans essential**. No alcohol. Water discipline.

### 4. West Africa: The Slog (Feb 2 - Feb 6)
*   **Distance**: ~350 km (Nouakchott to Banjul).
*   **Drive Load**: **~6-8 Hours/Day** (despite short distances).
*   **Reality**: The road to Diama is bad (mud/potholes). Border crossings are slow. Speed bumps in Senegal kill momentum. Ferries in Gambia are unpredictable.

## Fuel & Logistics Strategy
*   **Jerry Cans**: Fill **ALL** cans (40L+) at **Hotel Barbas** (Morocco) before entering Mauritania. Fuel in Mauritania is dirty/expensive.
*   **Cash**:
    *   **Euros**: King. Keep small notes (€5, €10, €20) for borders/fees.
    *   **Dirham (MAD)**: Closed currency. Spend or exchange before exiting Morocco.
    *   **CFA (XOF)**: Used in Senegal. Get some at the border or Diama.
    *   **Dalasi (GMD)**: Gambia. Cash economy.
*   **Convoy Comms**: Radios (TIDRADIO) on Channel 1 (or agreed frequency). Check in every hour.
