Failure to meet these deadlines may result in missing the convoy, border crossings, or the finish line events.

*   **Jan 16 (Day 1)**: **START** (London/Calais).
*   **Jan 18 (Day 3)**: **DEADLINE** - Arrival in **Tarifa** (Spain) for "Shit Shirts Night".
*   **Jan 19 (Day 4)**: **Ferry Crossing** to Tangier Med (08:00/09:00 AM sailing).
*   **Jan 27 (Day 12)**: **DEADLINE** - Arrival at **Hotel Barbas** (Morocco South) by evening.

## Daily Rhythm & Drive Loads

### 1. Europe: The Sprint (Jan 16 - 19)
*   **Objective**: Get south as fast as possible.
*   **Distance**: ~2,225 km (Calais to Tarifa).
*   **Drive Load**: **~9-11 Hours/Day**.
*   **Reality**: It is a boring motorway slog. Rotate drivers frequently. Avoid Paris.
*   **Fuel**: Expensive (France) -> Moderate (Spain) -> Cheap (Gibraltar/Morocco).

### 2. Morocco: The Marathon (Jan 19 - 27)
*   **Distance**: ~2,000 km (Tangier to Barbas).
*   **Drive Load**: **~5-7 Hours/Day** (North) -> **~7-9 Hours/Day** (South/Western Sahara).
*   **Reality**: North is slow (mountains/traffic). South is fast but monotonous (endless desert highway).
*   **Hazards**: Speed traps (Sign trick!), Night driving (Don't do it).

### 3. The Desert: The Challenge (Jan 28 - 31)
*   **Distance**: ~500 km (Barbas to Nouakchott).
*   **Drive Load**: **~8-12 Hours/Day** (Variable).
*   **Reality**: "No Man's Land" crossing takes hours. The drive to Nouakchott is paved but potholed and windy.
*   **Logistics**: **Jerry cans essential**. No alcohol. Water discipline.

### 4. West Africa: The Slog (Jan 31 - Feb 6)
*   **Distance**: ~350 km (Nouakchott to Banjul).
*   **Drive Load**: **~6-8 Hours/Day** (despite short distances).
*   **Reality**: The road to Diama is bad (mud/potholes). Border crossings are slow. Speed bumps in Senegal kill momentum. Ferries in Gambia are unpredictable.

## Fuel & Logistics Strategy
*   **Jerry Cans**: Fill **ALL** cans (40L+) at **Hotel Barbas** (Morocco) before entering Mauritania. Fuel in Mauritania is dirty/expensive.
*   **Cash**:
    *   **Euros**: King. Keep small notes (€5, €10, €20) for borders/fees.
    *   **Dirham (MAD)**: Closed currency. Spend or exchange before exiting Morocco.
    *   **CFA (XOF)**: Used in Senegal. Get some at the border or Diama.
    *   **Dalasi (GMD)**: Gambia. Cash economy.
*   **Convoy Comms**: Radios (TIDRADIO) on Channel 1 (or agreed frequency). Check in every hour.
