# Morocco (~Jan 19 -- Jan 28 2026)
*   **Start Date**: ~Jan 19, 2026
*   **End Date**: ~Jan 28, 2026
*   **Duration**: ~10 Days
*   **Visa**: Visa-free (<90 days). Passport 6mo validity.
*   **Weather**: **Variable**. North/Coast (17°C Day / 8°C Night). Atlas Mountains (**FREEZING** -5°C to 10°C, Snow possible). Desert (20°C+ Day / Cold Nights).

## 1. Pre-Entry Prep
*   **Ferry**: Preferred route is **Algeciras to Tangier Med**.
    *   *Why*: Immigration is done *on the ferry* (saving hours).
    *   *Timing*: 08:00 or 09:00 sailings recommended. Cost ~€229 (Car+2pax).
*   **Documents**:
    *   **Immigration Card**: Fill out on ferry. Use "CIN" number if you have visited before.
    *   **Vehicle Import**: "Passavant" (Green/White card) issued at customs. **DO NOT LOSE THIS**. It is your car's passport.
*   **Money**: Dirham (MAD) is a closed currency. Exchange Euros/Dollars at the border (Tangier Med port cabins).
    *   *Strategy*: Get enough cash for fuel/tolls/food for the whole traverse. ATMs exist but can be unreliable south of Marrakech.
*   **SIM Cards**: Buy at Tangier Med border. **Local SIMs** (Maroc Telecom/Orange) are better/cheaper than eSIMs like Airalo.
*   **Drone Warning**: **DO NOT BRING A DRONE**. It will be confiscated, or you will be fined/searched.
*   **Insurance**: You can buy "Assurance Frontier" at the port (cabins). ~55-65€ for 2 weeks.

## 2. Route & Driving Conditions
*   **Hazards**:
    *   **Speed Traps**: Prolific. Radar guns everywhere. Fines ~150-600 MAD.
        *   **"The Sign Trick"**: When in a 60kph zone and you see an "80" sign, **DO NOT SPEED UP** until you have *passed* the sign. Police hide *exactly* there.
        *   **Cameras**: Small, grey, hard to see.
    *   **Night Driving**: **AVOID**. "50 ton of gravel in the middle of the road, not a cone or flashing light."
    *   **Checkpoints**: Frequent south of Tan Tan. Have "Fiches" (personal info sheets) ready to hand over to save time.
*   **Western Sahara (Southern Provinces)**:
    *   **Sensitivity**: Never say "Western Sahara". Use "Southern Provinces". **Maps showing the border line will be confiscated/destroyed**.
    *   **Stickers**: Ensure no stickers on the car imply a divided Morocco.
    *   **Fuel**: Becomes scarce south of Tan Tan. Fill up whenever you see a station.
    *   **Route**: Single coastal road (N1). Long, dull driving.

## 3. Required Stops
*   **Rest Stops**: Chefchaouen (Blue City), Marrakech or Fez.
*   **Mandatory Rally Point**: **Hotel Barbas** (Bir Gandouz).
    *   **Date**: **Jan 27th** (Arrive evening).
    *   Located ~60 miles before the Mauritanian border.
    *   **MUST** meet here to convoy for the border crossing early morning Jan 28th.
    *   Fill fuel cans here (3 stations available).

## 4. Safety & Culture (Practical)
*   **Conduct**:
    *   Haggling is expected in Souks.
    *   Ask permission before photographing locals.
    *   Alcohol is available in larger hotels/supermarkets (Carrefour) but discreet. Stock up in Dakhla (backstreet shops) before Mauritania.
*   **Corruption/Bribes**:
    *   **Code Word**: "Green Tea".
    *   **Strategy**: Feign ignorance ("What, where, when?"). Hand over Fiches first.
*   **Scams**:
    *   **Toll Booths**: Check the digital display price. Do not rely on verbal price.
    *   **Fuel Attendants**: Watch the pump being zeroed.

## 5. Pre-Exit Checklist
*   **Customs**: Vehicle must be "exported" (stamped out) of your passport.
*   **Currency**: Exchange leftover Dirham *before* leaving (cannot export).
*   **Supplies**: **STOCK UP ON WATER & FUEL**. Mauritania is expensive and dry.
