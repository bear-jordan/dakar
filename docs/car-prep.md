# Vehicle Preparation Guide

**Source**: Based on the Dakar Challenge Roadbook.
**Objective**: Ensure the vehicle is legal, reliable, and capable of crossing 4,400 miles of diverse terrain, from European highways to the Sahara Desert.

## 1. Mandatory Legal Kit
Failure to carry these items can result in on-the-spot fines in Europe and Africa.

### Europe (France & Spain)
*   **Warning Triangles**: **Two** required (one for front, one for back).
*   **High-Vis Jackets**: One for **each** occupant. Must be accessible from *inside* the car (do not store in boot).
*   **Headlamp Converters**: Sticker patches to deflect beam for driving on the right.
*   **UK Sticker**: Mandatory on the rear (unless using EU plates).
*   **Spare Bulbs**: Full kit of replacement exterior bulbs.
*   **Breathalyzer**: (France) Technically required, though fines are currently suspended. Best to have one.
*   **Crit-Air Sticker**: (France) Required for certain cities (Rouen, Paris, etc.). Order online in advance.

### Africa

*   **Tow Rope**: Mandatory for being towed out of sand/breakdowns.
*   **Fiches**: 50-100 printed copies of the Personal Information Sheet (template in Roadbook).
    *   *Tip*: Print 4 per A4 page. Used to "pay" police instead of cash bribes.
*   **Documents**:
    *   **V5 (Logbook)**: Original + Colour Copies.
    *   **MOT**: Valid for the duration (even if not strictly checked in Africa).
    *   **Insurance**: Green Card for Europe; local insurance purchased at borders for Africa.

### Admin: "The Buck Database"
*   **Mandatory Uploads**: You must upload scans of your documents to the organizer's "Buck" database.
    *   **V5C**: Page 1 (Red front) and Page 2 (Inside details). **DO NOT upload MOT**.
    *   **Passport**: Bio page.
    *   **E-Visa**: Mauritania E-Visa scan.
    *   *Note*: Each driver must login separately. Only the *lead driver* uploads car docs.

## 2. Essential Spares
You cannot rely on finding specific parts for your specific car in the desert.

*   **Fluid Top-ups**: 1L Oil, 1L Brake Fluid, 1L Power Steering Fluid, 5L Water (Coolant).
*   **Filters**: Spare Air Filter (dust will clog the first one) & Fuel Filter (bad fuel).
*   **Belts**: Spare Alternator/Fan belt.
*   **Fix-it Kit**:
    *   **Radweld / K-Seal**: For radiator leaks.
    *   **Metal Putty / JB Weld**: For cracked sumps or tanks.
    *   **Gaffer Tape & Zip Ties**: Lots of them.
    *   **Jubilee Clips**: Assorted sizes.
    *   **Electrical Wire & Fuses**: Spare fuses for every rating.
*   **Tools**:
    *   Jack (Bottle or Scissor) + Base plate (wood) for sand.
    *   Wheel Brace.
    *   Basic Socket Set & Spanners.
    *   Screwdrivers, Pliers, Hammer.
    *   **Jerry Cans**: Minimum **2 x 20L** Metal Cans for Fuel (Diesel preferred).

## 3. Recovery Gear
Getting stuck is guaranteed. Be self-sufficient.

*   **Sand Ladders**: **MANDATORY**. Do not enter the desert without them.
    *   **Type**: **RIGID ONLY** (MaxTrax style). Plastic is lighter/safer than metal.
    *   **Warning**: Carpet/Flexi-tracks **DO NOT WORK**.
*   **Tow Strap**: Heavy-duty rated strap (not a cheap elastic rope).
*   **Shovel**: Folding military shovel or garden spade.
*   **Air Compressor**: 12V pump to re-inflate tyres after sand driving (where you drop pressure to ~10psi).
*   **Pressure Gauge**: Accurate gauge for sand driving.
*   **Gloves**: Heavy-duty work gloves for digging/towing.

## 4. Organization & Logistics
*   **Walkie Talkies**: **OBLIGATORY**.
    *   **Model**: **TIDRADIO TD-H8** (Group Standard).
    *   *Setup*: User interface is tricky. Use "ODMASTER" or "TidKit" app to program.
    *   *Usage*: Required for convoy communication (sand driving, police checks, overtaking).
    *   *Note*: Hide them at borders (technically licensed in some countries).
*   **Water Storage**:
    *   Carry **double** the water you think you need.
    *   Large 5L/10L containers for emergency use.
*   **Keys**: Bring a **SPARE SET** and keep them on a different person/magnetic box hidden on car.
*   **Navigation**:
    *   **Offline Maps**: Maps.me / OsmAnd+ (Download all country maps *before* leaving).
    *   **Paper Maps**: Michelin 741 (North/West Africa) as backup.
    *   **Compass**: Simple backup.
