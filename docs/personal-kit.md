# Personal Gear & Survival Kit

**Objective**: Equip each team member for a journey that spans three distinct climates: European Winter, High Altitude Cold, and Tropical Heat.

## 1. The "3 Climates" Clothing Strategy
You will experience -5°C in the Atlas Mountains and +40°C in the Sahara. Layering is key.

### Cold Weather (Europe & Atlas Mountains)
*   **Base Layers**: Thermals (Top and bottoms) are essential for camping in the desert winter nights and the Atlas mountains.
*   **Outer Shell**: A good waterproof/windproof jacket.
*   **Extremities**: Warm hat (beanie) and gloves.
*   **Footwear**: Boots or sturdy shoes for cold nights/digging in sand.

### Desert & Tropical Heat (Mauritania to Gambia)
*   **Headwear**: Wide-brimmed hat or "Chech" (local headscarf) to protect from sun and sandstorms.
*   **Loose Clothing**: Linen/Cotton long trousers and long-sleeved shirts.
    *   *Why?* Sun protection, bug protection (malaria mosquitoes), and cultural modesty.
*   **Sandals**: For the hot days in the car.

### Cultural Modesty (Important)
*   **Women**: Long skirts/trousers and loose tops covering shoulders/chest are recommended in Mauritania and rural Morocco. Headscarf not strictly required but useful to have.
*   **Men**: Long trousers are preferred over shorts in conservative areas.
*   **Senegal/Gambia**: Dress becomes much more liberal/vibrant.

## 2. Camping System
There are **no hotels** in the desert section. You must be self-sufficient.

*   **Tent**: **Self-supporting / Geodesic**.
    *   *Critical*: You cannot peg a tent into loose sand. Pop-up tents or those that stand up with just poles are essential.
*   **Sleeping Bag**: **3-4 Season Rating**.
    *   *Warning*: The desert gets very cold at night (single digits). Do not bring a cheap festival sleeping bag.
*   **Sleeping Mat**: Inflatable or foam mat. The ground is often rocky (Hamada) or cold.
*   **Furniture**: Camping chairs are highly recommended for the evening campfires.

## 3. Personal Hygiene & Comfort
*   **"Bush Shower"**: Baby wipes (large packs), hand sanitizer, dry shampoo.
*   **Toilet Kit**:
    *   **Toilet Paper**: Take lots. Remove cardboard tube to squash flat for packing.
    *   **Travel Shovel**: For burying waste (Leave No Trace).
    *   **Ziploc Bags**: For used paper (burn or bin later).
*   **Sun & Bug Protection**:
    *   High SPF Sunscreen.
    *   **DEET Insect Repellent**: Vital for Senegal/Gambia (Malaria zone).
    *   Sunglasses (Polarized helps with glare).

## 4. Electronics & Utilities
*   **Power**:
    *   **12V Inverter**: To charge camera/drone/laptop batteries from the car cigarette lighter.
    *   **Power Banks**: 20,000mAh+ for phones.
*   **Lighting**:
    *   **Headtorch**: Essential for setting up camp/cooking in pitch black. (Red light mode preserves night vision).
    *   **Solar Lantern**: For the camp table.
*   **Audio**: Download Spotify playlists / Podcasts offline (Signal is rare).

## 5. Food & Cooking
*   **Stove**: Small gas camping stove (Jetboil or similar) for coffee/noodles.
*   **Fuel**: Buy extra gas canisters in Europe (hard to find correct fittings in Africa).
*   **Utensils**: Mug, Plate, Spork, Sharp Knife.
*   **Food Stash**:
    *   **MREs / Ration Packs**: Good for "manifold cooking" (heating on the engine).
    *   **Snacks**: Energy bars, nuts, dried fruit for long driving stints.
    *   **Water**: LifeStraw bottle or purification tablets as backup.

## 6. Packing Strategy
*   **Soft Bags Only**: Do not bring hard-shell suitcases. They are impossible to pack tightly in a car full of spares.
*   **Day Bag**: Keep essentials (Passport, Fiches, Water, Camera) in a small bag at your feet.
