# Daily Morning Vehicle Checks
*Perform this 5-minute routine every morning before the engine starts.*

## 1. The Walkaround (Exterior)
- [ ] **Underbody Scan**: Look for fresh puddles under the car.
    -   *Black puddle* = Oil.
    -   *Green/Red/Clear puddle* = Coolant/Water.
    -   *Smell of Gas* = Fuel leak.
- [ ] **Tyres**: Visually check for soft tyres.
    -   *Kick Test*: Give them a firm kick.
    -   *Sidewalls*: Check for bulges or deep cuts from rocks.
- [ ] **Roof Rack**: Wiggle the load.
    -   *Straps*: Retighten rachet straps (they loosen overnight with temperature changes).
    -   *Jerry Cans*: Ensure they are locked/secure.

## 2. Under the Bonnet (Hood)
- [ ] **Oil Level**: Pull dipstick, wipe, dip, read. Top up if low.
- [ ] **Coolant**: Check reservoir level (Visual check through plastic).
    -   *Warning*: NEVER open the radiator cap if the engine is hot.
- [ ] **Brake Fluid**: Check reservoir level.
- [ ] **Belts**: Press the fan belt. It should have ~1cm of play.
- [ ] **Air Filter** (Desert Section Only):
    -   If driving in heavy dust, open the box and bang the filter out.

## 3. The Cockpit (Start-up)
- [ ] **Gauges**:
    -   Fuel Level: Do we need to stop *immediately* for fuel?
    -   Temp: Is it sitting normal?
- [ ] **Noises**: Listen to the idle. Any new ticking or squealing?
- [ ] **Comms**: Radio check ("Radio Check, Radio Check") on Channel 1.
- [ ] **Phone**: Maps downloaded? Charging cable working?

## 4. The "Fool" Check
- [ ] **Passports**: Does everyone have theirs?
- [ ] **Wallet**: Do we have the cash stash?
- [ ] **Water**: Do we have the daily drinking water in the car?
