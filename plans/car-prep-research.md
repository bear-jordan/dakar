# Vehicle Preparation Plan

**Objective**: Create a comprehensive `docs/car-prep.md` guide covering mandatory equipment, recommended mechanical upgrades, and spare parts for the London to Dakar rally.

## Phase 1: Roadbook Analysis
**Source**: `docs/_roadbook.txt`
Scan for keywords: "Kit", "Spares", "Tyres", "Tools", "Preparation", "Legal", "Breakdown".

**Key Categories to Extract**:
1.  **Legal/Mandatory Kit**:
    *   Europe (Triangle, Vests, Stickers).
    *   Africa (Fiches, Straps, Fire Extinguisher).
2.  **Mechanical Upgrades**:
    *   Sump guards? Raised suspension? Roof racks? (Check roadbook stance on "over-prepping").
3.  **Spares Inventory**:
    *   Specific fluids, filters, belts, and "unobtainium" parts for specific car models.
4.  **Recovery Gear**:
    *   Tow ropes, sand ladders, shovel.
5.  **Organization**:
    *   Jerry cans (fuel/water), storage boxes.

## Phase 2: Document Creation (`docs/car-prep.md`)
**Structure**:
```markdown
# Vehicle Preparation Guide

## 1. Mandatory Legal Kit
*   [List of items required by law in EU/Africa]

## 2. Vehicle "Hardening" (Modifications)
*   [Advice on sump guards, tyres, roof racks]

## 3. Essential Spares
*   [Consumables & specific car parts]

## 4. Recovery & Tools
*   [Tow ropes, sand ladders, tool kit basics]

## 5. Jerry Cans & Fluid Management
*   [Fuel/Water capacity rules]
```

## Phase 3: Cross-Check Country Guides
*   Review `docs/europe-transit.md`, `docs/morocco.md`, etc.
*   *Action*: If a specific item is critical for a specific leg (e.g., "Sand Ladders for Mauritania"), ensure it is referenced in that country's "Pre-Entry Prep" section if not already present.

## Phase 4: Execution
1.  Read `docs/_roadbook.txt` thoroughly for gear lists.
2.  Synthesize into `docs/car-prep.md`.
3.  Update specific country files if a *new* critical requirement is found that isn't currently listed.
