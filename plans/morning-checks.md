# Morning Vehicle Check Protocol Plan

**Objective**: Create a short, printable checklist (`docs/morning-checks.md`) for the daily pre-drive inspection.
**Context**: "Prevention is cheaper than a tow truck in the Sahara."

## Content Structure
The checklist should take < 5 minutes for two people to complete.

### 1. Under the Bonnet (Hood)
*   **Fluids**: Oil, Coolant, Brake Fluid, Screenwash.
*   **Belts**: Finger press test (tension).
*   **Leaks**: Look for wet patches on the engine block.

### 2. Exterior / Walkaround
*   **Tyres**: Visual check for deflation/bulges. Kick test.
*   **Underbody**: Look for puddles (Oil/Water/Fuel) on the ground.
*   **Load**: Roof rack straps tight? Jerry cans secure?

### 3. Cockpit
*   **Start-up**: Listen for new noises.
*   **Gauges**: Fuel level check (Do we need to fill up *now*?).
*   **Comms**: Radio check with convoy.

## Execution
1.  Create `docs/morning-checks.md`.
2.  Format as a checklist (Markdown `- [ ]`) so it can be printed or used digitally.
