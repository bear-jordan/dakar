# Personal Gear & Packing Research Plan

**Objective**: Create a `docs/personal-kit.md` guide covering clothing, camping equipment, and personal essentials.
**Context**: Medical/First Aid is handled by team doctors. Focus strictly on comfort, survival, and logistics.

## Phase 1: Environmental Context Analysis
*   **Europe/Atlas Mountains (Jan)**: Potential for snow, freezing rain, sub-zero nights.
*   **Sahara (Western Sahara/Mauritania)**: High UV days (25°C+), Cold nights (5-10°C), Sandstorms.
*   **West Africa (Senegal/Gambia)**: Tropical heat, humidity, dust.

## Phase 2: Roadbook Extraction
**Source**: `docs/_roadbook.txt`
*   **Camping**: Look for advice on tent types (pop-up vs. pole?), sleeping bag ratings (3-season vs 4-season?), and mats.
*   **Food/Cooking**: Identify if we need full cooking stoves/gas or just snacks. Advice on "Dry" days (Mauritania).
*   **Clothing**: Look for "modesty" advice (shorts vs. long pants) for Mauritania/Morocco.

## Phase 3: Structure of `docs/personal-kit.md`
The final document should be categorized as follows:

### 1. Camping System
*   **Shelter**: Tent recommendations (easy pitch for tired drivers).
*   **Sleep**: Sleeping bag ratings (Critical for Atlas/Desert nights).
*   **Furniture**: Chairs (essential for desert camps), tables.

### 2. Clothing Strategy
*   **The "3 Climates" Problem**: How to pack for Winter Europe -> Desert Cold -> Tropical Heat.
*   **Modesty**: Specific rules for men/women in conservative areas.
*   **Footwear**: Sandal vs. Boot debate.

### 3. Personal Hygiene & Comfort
*   **"Bush Shower"**: Baby wipes, dry shampoo, sanitizer.
*   **Protection**: Sunscreen (high SPF), Insect Repellent (DEET for Senegal), Dust masks (Sandstorms).

### 4. Electronics & Utilities
*   **Power**: Power banks, Car inverters (12V to 240V), Headtorches (Red light mode for camp).
*   **Organization**: Packing cubes/Soft bags (Hard suitcases are bad for packing tight cars).

## Phase 4: Actionable Tasks
1.  **Scan Roadbook**: specific mentions of "Cold", "Tent", "Stove", "Modest".
2.  **Synthesize**: Create the comprehensive packing list.
3.  **Update Todos**: Add "Buy Sleeping Bag" or "Test Tent" to `docs/_todos.md`.
