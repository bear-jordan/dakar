# WhatsApp Intelligence Integration Plan

**Objective**: Systematically merge the real-time intelligence gathered from the WhatsApp logs (`*-whatsapp.md`) into the primary country guides and todo lists. 
**Principle**: Real-time "boots on the ground" advice (WhatsApp) takes precedence over the static Roadbook if there is a conflict.

## Phase 1: General Prep & Admin Integration
**Source**: `docs/general-whatsapp.md`
**Targets**: `docs/car-prep.md`, `docs/_todos.md`

1.  **Update `docs/car-prep.md`**:
    *   **Radio Spec**: Specify **TIDRADIO TD-H8** as the mandatory group standard.
    *   **Sand Ladders**: Reinforce **RIGID** only (debunk "carpet myth").
    *   **Admin**: Add a section on "The Buck Database" requirements (V5C uploads).
2.  **Update `docs/_todos.md`**:
    *   Add "Upload V5C/Passport to Database" task.
    *   Add "Download ODMASTER/TidKit app" for radios.
    *   Add "Print Fiches (4 per page)" task.

## Phase 2: Country Guide Enhancement
**Strategy**: Consolidate duplicates. If the Roadbook says "Bring Fiches" and WhatsApp says "Bring Fiches to avoid bribes", merge into a single strong instruction.

### 1. Morocco (`docs/morocco.md`)
*   **Merge**: `docs/morocco-whatsapp.md`
*   **Key Additions**:
    *   **The "Sign Trick"**: Detailed warning about 60->80kph speed traps.
    *   **Politics**: Reinforce the "Southern Provinces" map taboo (border guards destroying maps).
    *   **Bribes**: Add the **"Green Tea"** code word context.

### 2. Mauritania (`docs/mauritania.md`)
*   **Merge**: `docs/mauritania-whatsapp.md`
*   **Key Additions**:
    *   **Visa Criticality**: Warning **NOT** to use the word "Rally" on applications.
    *   **Alcohol**: Specific warning about the €100/bottle fine risk.
    *   **Route**: Clarify "Desert vs Road" group split requirements.

### 3. Senegal (`docs/senegal.md`)
*   **Merge**: `docs/senegal-whatsapp.md`
*   **Key Additions**:
    *   **Car Pass**: Details on the pre-paid "Senegal 1 Car Pass" system vs the old system.
    *   **Zebrabar**: Confirm "No booking needed for camping" status.

### 4. The Gambia (`docs/the-gambia.md`)
*   **Merge**: `docs/gambia-whatsapp.md`
*   **Key Additions**:
    *   **Ferry**: Mention the new private "Ngemarr" ferry option.
    *   **Auction**: Clarify the "Leave V5C slip" process for UK teams.

## Phase 3: Cleanup
1.  Verify all "New" intel is transferred.
2.  Delete the temporary `*-whatsapp.md` files to maintain a clean `docs/` directory.

## Execution Instructions
*   Read the target file first to understand existing context.
*   Insert new points logically under existing headers (e.g., put "Speed Trap Trick" under "Driving Conditions").
*   Do not simply append; weave the information in.
