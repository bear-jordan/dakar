# Car Diagnostics Cheat Sheet Plan

**Objective**: Create a `docs/car-diagnostics.md` cheat sheet focused on "Get Home" fixes for non-mechanics.
**Scope**: Common noises/symptoms manageable with basic tools and the spares listed in `car-prep.md`. No engine rebuilds.

## Content Structure

### 1. The "Noise" Index
*   **Squealing (Engine)**: Loose belt. -> *Fix*: Tighten or replace.
*   **Grinding (Brakes)**: Pads worn metal-to-metal. -> *Fix*: Drive slow, use engine braking, replace ASAP.
*   **Clicking (Turning)**: CV Joint. -> *Fix*: Drive gentle, avoid full lock turns.
*   **Hissing (Engine)**: Coolant leak/Overheating. -> *Fix*: Stop, cool down, tape/radweld.
*   **Roaring (Speed-dependent)**: Wheel Bearing. -> *Fix*: Drive slow, monitor heat.

### 2. The "Bush Mechanic" Fixes (Temporary Limp-Home)
*   **Radiator Leak**: Egg white / Pepper / Radweld.
*   **Broken Fan Belt**: Pantyhose (Tights) trick.
*   **Fuel Tank Leak**: Rub bar of soap on crack (temporary seal).
*   **Blown Fuse**: Use foil (DANGEROUS - Last resort) or swap with non-essential fuse (radio).

### 3. Vital Fluids Check
*   **Milky Oil**: Head gasket blown. -> *Action*: Game over (usually). Keep water topped up, drive gently until death.
*   **Black Smoke**: Running rich (Air filter clogged?). -> *Action*: Remove/bang out dust from filter.

## Execution
1.  Synthesize common "banger rally" breakdown advice.
2.  Keep it simple: **Symptom -> Cause -> Bodge Fix -> Professional Fix Priority**.
3.  Cross-reference with the tools we told you to buy (Tape, Zip ties, Radweld).
